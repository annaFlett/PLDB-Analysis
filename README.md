# PLDB Analysis 

A data anaylsis of the Programming Languages Database (found at : https://pldb.io/csv.html), where I aim to answer a few questions I set myself, using the the information in this database. These questions include : 
- Which are the most popular languages and does this depend on the 'metric' we use the gauge popularity?
- Where and when did most languages originate?
- Do certain feautures always tend to appear in the most popular languages and are there some features which are ubiquitous?
